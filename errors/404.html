    Tempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be,
    under whatsoever conditions ye may live, know
    this in the ocean of life the isles of Blessed-
    ness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your
    ideal awaits your coming. Keep your hand
    firmly upon the helm of thought. In the
    barque of your soul reclines the commanding
    Master; He does but sleep; wake Him. Self-
    control is strength; Right Thought is mas-
    tery; Calmness is power. Say unto your heart,
    "Peace, be still!"
